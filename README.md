## design decisions or assumptions
Design Decisions:

Bootstrap Framework: Bootstrap will be used as the main CSS framework to leverage its grid system, components, and utility classes for faster and responsive web development.

SCSS Preprocessing: SCSS will be used for CSS preprocessing to take advantage of its variables, mixins, and nesting features, making the stylesheets more maintainable and modular.

Responsive Design: The application will be designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

Custom Styles: While Bootstrap will be used for layout and basic styling, custom SCSS styles will be applied to give the application a unique look and feel.

Browser Support: The application will be tested and optimized for modern browsers, with graceful degradation for older browsers where necessary.

Assumptions:

Bootstrap Customization: We assume that the default Bootstrap styles will be sufficient for most components, but customization may be required for specific design requirements.

SCSS Compilation: We assume that a build tool like Webpack or Gulp will be used to compile the SCSS files into CSS for production deployment.

Bootstrap Updates: We assume that Bootstrap will continue to be maintained and updated and that any future updates will be compatible with the current version used in the project.

Performance: We assume that the performance of the application will be acceptable, considering the use of Bootstrap's optimized CSS and the application's overall design and structure.

Accessibility: While Bootstrap provides some accessibility features, we assume that additional accessibility testing and improvements may be necessary to ensure full compliance with accessibility standards.
